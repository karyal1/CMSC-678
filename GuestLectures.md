## Abstract of the Talk:
The talk will discuss the role of human-centred research in the effective use and deployment of AI systems in highstakes domains such as public health. I will discuss the design and learnings from a real-world deployment of a large-scale AI system that aims to improve the efficacy of (maternal and neonatal) public health information delivery in marginalized communities in India. I will enrich the discussion through our qualitative work that discusses the role of AI as an actor that generates human-human collaboration. I will also discuss the tensions in the data supply chain that impact data quality and how we can build greater accountability in not just ML models but also datasets.
