# Introduction to Machine Learning CMSC-678

The course will provide extensive grounding in machine learning models and its utility to make predictions. The course will go over the mathematical foundations and real world applications of machine learning. The course will slowly move over the topics like prediction and classification problems, kernel methods, generative modeling, probability theory, optimization theory, representation learning, neural networks, and many more. In process, the course would teach some of the limitations of machine learning and how to augment them with better methods.

Slides, materials, and project information for this iteration of machine learning course are borrowed from Andrew Ng, Sanjoy Dasgupta, Tom Mitchell, Maria-Florina Balcan, Hal Daume III, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tsibrani.
