## Project Templates

Please choose one of the following templates to submit the final project report: 
* [NeurIPS Template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/neurips-2022/kxymzbjpwsqx)
* [ACM Official Template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-conference-proceedings-primary-article-template/wbvnghjbzwpc)

## Timelines (To-Be-Decided)

* Abstract of the Project (A Class Presentation): A Project Proposal : __October 13, 2022__ (Thursday)
    * _Expectation from the Project Proposal:_ Each team should update [EXCEL SPREADSHEET](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17Wv_hqMpghsEjdN6DaV2cs5DhWvQc7g0pIOTmz7Hcvk/edit#gid=0) with their project title and prepare a __10 minutes__ presentation. The presentation should clearly bring across three main points: (1) Motivation (Real-world examples of the project that would show the importance of project), (2) Problem Statement, (3) Why Machine Learning is appropriate?, (4) Potential Datasets, and (5) Problem Modeling (similar to Question 1 in HTCA-1).  
* Project Update (A Class Presentation): __November 17, 2022__ (Thursday)
* Project Report Review : __After Thanksgiving Break__ Tuesdays and Thursdays (Office Hours)
* Project Report Submission : __December 15, 2022__ (Thursday)
* Project Presentation : __December 15 and December 20, 2022__ (Thursday and Tuesday)

## Broad Topics:

Introduction to Machine Learning, Learning Problem, Generative Modeling, Linear Regression and Probability Estimation, Optimization and Geometry, Support Vector Machine and Kernel Methods, Trees and Forest, Probabilistic Graphical Models, Learning Theory, Representation Learning (Basic projects in Deep Learning) and Interpretable, Explainable Machine Learning. 

## Example Datasets
* https://pslcdatashop.web.cmu.edu/KDDCup/downloads.jsp
* http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php
* [ML Collective](https://mlcollective.org/projects/)
* [NBA statistics data](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Eawm/10701/project/databasebasketball2.0.zip): This download contains 2004-2005 NBA and ABA stats for:
    * Player regular season stats
    * Player regular season career totals
    * Player playoff stats
    * Player playoff career totals
    * Player all-star game stats
    * Team regular season stats
    * Complete draft history
    * coaches_season.txt - nba coaching records by season
    * coaches_career.txt - nba career coaching records


Currently all of the regular season. __Project idea__:
  * outlier detection on the players; find out who are the outstanding players.
  * predict the game outcome.

* [CMU World Wide Knowledge Base (Web->KB) project](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~webkb/): 
    * __Project ideas__: 
    
    
    (a) Learning classifiers to predict the type of webpage from the text. 
    
    (b) Can you improve accuracy by exploiting correlations between pages that point to each other using graphical models?

* [Email Annotation](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~einat/datasets.html): The datasets provided below are sets of emails. The goal is to identify which parts of the email refer to a person name. This task is an example of the general problem area of Machine Learning and Information Extraction.
    * __Project Ideas__: Model the task as a Sequential Labeling problem, where each email is a sequence of tokens, and each token can have either a label of "person-name" or "not-a-person-name".
    * [Sample Project Report](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~einat/email.pdf)
